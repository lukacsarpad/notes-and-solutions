# notes-and-solutions
This repository contains notes I take on topics of interest to me (mostly physics and mathematics), and solutions to problems in textbooks I use to brush up my knowledge on some topics.

The text of the problems is not included in the solutions due to copyright reasons.

## Contents

 * `CLFields` Notes on classical field theory (a choice of signature, normalisation, used to calculate conserved quantities, such as energy, momentum, spin, etc.)
 * `stat` Statistics: currently contains solutions to R.J.&nbsp;Barlow, Statistics (Manchester Physics series, Wiley, 1989)
 * `laguerre` Laguerre polynomials. A collection of the notations used by references, to help comparing formulae from different sources.
 * `compscal` Complex scalar fields. Very old notes on what it means to take derivatives independently w.r.t. the field and its conjugate.
